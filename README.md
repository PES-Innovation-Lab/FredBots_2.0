# ROS2
Design and implementation of a multi-agent path planning system using the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) framework. The system leverages ROS2â€™s various communication models to enable realtime efficient coordination between multiple autonomous agents operating in a shared multi-level environment

**System Info:** These packages were tested on Ubuntu 22.04 with ROS Humble.

### Runtime Instructions

Open Terminal 
```
mkdir ros2_ws
cd ros2_ws && mkdir src
cd src
```
After cloning the repo and building it, just type `ros2 launch rviz_marker display_marker.launch.py` into the terminal to get started. 
This will launch Rviz and show a 10x10 grid <br>
Then type `ros2 run agent service_test` on another terminal to display the agent marker on the grid

```
Ready to update goal pose for agent
```

To Broadcast Transforms type `ros2 service call /update_goal my_robot_interfaces/srv/UpdateGoal "goal_pose:` 
(hit tab)
```
  position:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
  orientation:
    x: 0.0
    y: 0.0
    z: 0.0
    w: 1.0"
```
Send a Geometry Pose msg to call the service

   ```

#### Containerizing:

1. **Build the Dockerfile:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t my_ros_container .
   ```

2. Run the docker container : 
    ```
    docker run -it --rm --net=host --privileged \
        --env="DISPLAY" \
        --env="QT_X11_NO_MITSHM=1" \
        --volume="/tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:rw" \
        -v "~/Path_of_your_choice/ros2_ws/src:/ros2_ws/src" \
